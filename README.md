# trafficlight_with_ml

- Neural network used in this repository is originally from the textbook "Deep Learning from Scratch" by Saito Goki.
- The image data set is from the Udacity course "Introduction to Selfdrivng Car Nanodegree Program"
- I optimized the neural network architecture originally designed for the MNIST dataset to fit a traffic light image dataset.
- I trained and tested for a traffic light image dataset, resulting in 99% accuracy. (When using multi-layered NN, not CNN)
